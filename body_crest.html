    Anything between the masthead and the general body content. 
    
    This could include sign-in/sign-out links, site-wide search, navigation,
    breadcrumbs, etc.
    
    The actual modules to include here are kept in a separate template to
    reinforce the separation between any design required HTML elements and the
    inclusion of content, which are separate activities.
