    The site masthead. This generally means the site's name, logo and other
    site-wide branding.
    
    This could also include sign-in/sign-out links, site-wide search, etc.
    
    The actual modules to include here are kept in a separate template to
    reinforce the separation between any design required HTML elements and the
    inclusion of content, which are separate activities.
