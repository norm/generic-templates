    Anything that comes at the end of the page, after the general body
    content.
    
    This could include copyright notification, licensing, terms & conditions,
    site colophon, etc.
    
    The actual modules to include here are kept in a separate template to
    reinforce the separation between any design required HTML elements and the
    inclusion of content, which are separate activities.
